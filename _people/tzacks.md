I am a PhD student in the Informatics Program in the School of Information Sciences. I'm
interested in the cross-section of data visualization and astrophysics and would like to
create astrophysical science visualizations that are beautiful, scientifically sound, 
and accessible for everyone. I also hope to venture into other fields of scientific
inquiry, such as paleontology, to address discrepancies in the way that
data is shared, utilized, and visualized.
